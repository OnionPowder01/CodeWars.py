## Double Char


**Definition**

Given a string, you have to return a string in which each character (case-sensitive) is repeated once.

```
Examples (Input -> Output):
* "String"      -> "SSttrriinngg"
* "Hello World" -> "HHeelllloo  WWoorrlldd"
* "1234!_ "     -> "11223344!!__  "
```

```python
def double_char(s):
    return ''.join([char*2 for char in s])
```
